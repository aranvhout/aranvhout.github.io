            <p>Hi, my name is Aran van Hout. I am currently working as a research assistant at the <a href="https://lifespancognitivedynamics.com/" target="_blank">LCD-lab</a>, where I contribute to the OMMS project. In this project, I am developing a program that generates matrices for assessing fluid reasoning. <a href="https://www.aranvanhout.com/research.html" target="_blank">Learn more about the research here</a>.</p>

            <p>Beyond coding, I am fascinated by neuro-evolution and translational research. Studying brain differences across species to better understand our neuroecological niche is just super cool! I am also passionate about developmental research, working with big data, and exploring neuroimaging techniques.</p>

            <h3>Future Endeavours</h3>
            <p>Currently, I am on the look-out for a PhD related to the fields of neuroecology, developmental research, or neuroimaging! These are my dream subjects, and it would be amazing to further develop myself in these areas.</p>

            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <p>When I'm not doing research, I enjoy cycling, running, and swimming, although I am usually injured for about six months each year (the struggles of being too overeager). Luckily, I also like to play the guitar. I thought about linking my band's Instagram here, but after some careful reflection, I decided it’s probably best for everyone if I don't.</p>
